## To Do List

<span></span>

### <span id="Backup_your_password">1. Backup Your Password</span>

Unlike centralized web services, **it is not possible to recover lost passwords on the Blurt blockchain**.

You are entirely responsible for saving your password, backing it up, and keeping it secure.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage (such as a flash drive or burned CD), secure private cloud-based storage, as well as printed paper. Use multiple methods of storage for best redundancy.

If your account is valuable, value it!

### <span id="Choose_your_NSFW_(Not_Safe_for_Work)_Display_Preference">5. Choose your "NSFW" (Not Safe for Work) Display Preference, Language, and Rewards</span>

By default, content that users have tagged as "NSFW" will be hidden, but a link will be shown to reveal the content. You can update your display preference so that NSFW content is always shown by default or is completely hidden with no option to reveal.

Your [https://discord.blurt.world/](https://discord.blurt.world/) account is a separate account from your Blurt account.

### <span id="Create_your_introduceyourself_post">7. Create your "Introduceyourself" Post</span>

While not required, the tradition for new users is to create an "introduceyourself" post in order to let the community get to know you.

You can see some examples of what other people have done. Many users like to take a picture of themselves holding up a piece of paper that says "Blurt" with the current date.

If you have other social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) you can help the community verify that you are who you say you are by sharing the link to your Blurt profile on them. If you are claiming to be someone famous, this is pretty much expected.

Tags will help people find your posts. Each post can have up to five tags, separated by spaces. The tags should all be relevant to the content in the post. You can browse content by tags, as well as see a list of popular tags that other users have used in their posts. The first tag becomes the post's category and cannot be changed later.

Authors also have the option to decline payout, or be paid in Blurt Power!

The community is looking for you to create engaging content.

If you are using anyone else's material as part of your posts (including images), even if it is free to use, please cite your sources. You should make sure that you are not violating any copyright laws if you are using someone else's material/images. Limited, sourced material sharing is OK under fair use and fair dealing doctrines.

Remember, your posts should have original content in them. Quotes should not compose an entire post. Include your own thoughts, photographs, art, and ideas.
